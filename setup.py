WConio2.py
----------

This module is a pure Python reimplementation of my WConio module, and is
generally API compatible with version 1.5.1 of that module.  WConio2 provides a
color console interface for Windows applications using an interface based
generally on the conio.h functions included with Turbo C 2.0.  While the
original module depended on code written by Daniel Guerrero Miralles, this
module includes none of his code.

The conio.h functions don't map perfectly to Python, so I have taken some
liberties.  In particular, the window() functionality is not provided, and
screen coordinates are based at 0, 0 (logical for Python, but counter to the
tradition of conio.h).

If you are porting an application written for the original WConio, it's
perfectly acceptable to say:

import WConio2 as WConio
